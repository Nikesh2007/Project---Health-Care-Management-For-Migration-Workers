# Project---Health-Care-Management-For-Migration-Workers
We built a hospital web portal for registering hospitals and storing patient data/reports in Firebase (text) and AWS (PDFs). The system helps government track disease outbreaks by pincode. Patients can access their reports anytime via our Android app ‘Arogyam’. Built for SIH Hackathon.
